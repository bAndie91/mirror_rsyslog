<h1>global() configuration object</h1>

<p>The global configuration object permits to set global parameters.
Note that each parameter can only be set once and cannot be re-set
thereafter. If a parameter is set multiple times, the behaviour is
unpredictable.

<p>The following paramters can be set:
<ul>
<li><b>action.reportSuspension</b> - binary, default "on", v7.5.8+<br>
If enabled ("on") action will log message under syslog.* when an action 
suspends or resume itself. This usually happens when there are problems
connecting to backend systems. If disabled ("off"), these messages are
not generated. These messages can be useful in detecting problems with
backend systems. Most importantly, frequent suspension and resumption
points to a problem area.
<li><b>action.reportSuspensionContinuation</b> - binary, default "off", v7.6.1+, v8.2.0+<br>
If enabled ("on") the action will not only report the first suspension but
each time the suspension is prolonged. Otherwise, the follow-up messages
are not logged. If this setting is set to "on", action.reportSuspension is
also automaticaly turned "on".
<li>workDirectory
<li>dropMsgsWithMaliciousDNSPtrRecords
<li>localHostname
<li>preserveFQDN
<li>defaultNetstreamDriverCAFile
<li>defaultNetstreamDriverKeyFile
<li>defaultNetstreamDriver
<li>maxMessageSize
<li><b>debug.onShutdown</b> binary (on/off), available in 7.5.8+<br>
If enabled ("on"), rsyslog will log debug messages when a system shutdown
is requested. This can be used to track issues that happen only during
shutdown. During normal operations, system performance is NOT affected.
<br>Note that for this option to be useful, the debug.logFile parameter
must also be set (or the respective environment variable).
<li><b>debug.logFile</b> available in 7.5.8+<br>
This is used to specify the debug log file name. It is used for all debug
output. Please note that the RSYSLOG_DEBUGLOG environment variable always
<b>overrides</b> the value of debug.logFile.

<li><b>processInternalMessages</b> binary (on/off), available in v7.4.9+, 7.6.0+, 8.1.5+<br>
This tell rsyslog if it shall process internal messages itself. This
is the default mode of operations ("on") and usually the best. However,
if this (instance) of rsyslog is not the main instance and there is
another main logging system, rsyslog internal messages will not be
inserted into the main instance's syslog stream. To do this, set
the parameter to "off", in which case rsyslog will send messages to
the system log sink (and if it is the only instance, receive them back
from there). This also works with systemd journal and will make
rsyslog messages show up in the systemd status control information.

<h1>Compatibility Notes for rsyslog v7</h1>
This document describes things to keep in mind when moving from v6 to v7. It 
does not list enhancements nor does it talk about compatibility concerns introduced
by earlier versions (for this, see their respective compatibility documents). Its focus
is primarily on what you need to know if you used v6 and want to use v7 without hassle.
<p>Version 7 builds on the new config language introduced in v6 and extends it.
Other than v6, it not just only extends the config language, but provides
considerable changes to core elements as well. The result is much more power and
ease of use as well (this time that is not contradictionary).
</p>
<h2>BSD-Style blocks</h2>
BSD style blocks are no longer supported (for good reason). See the
<a href="http://www.rsyslog.com/g/BSD">rsyslog BSD blocks info</a>
page for more information and how to upgrade your config.

<h2>CEE-Properties</h2>
In rsyslog v6, CEE properties could not be used across disk-based queues. If this was
done, there content was reset. This was a missing feature in v6. In v7, this feature
has been implemented. Consequently, situations where the previous behaviour were
desired need now to be solved differently. We do not think that this will cause any
problems to anyone, especially as in v6 this was announced as a missing feature.

<h2>omruleset and discard (~) action are deprecated</h2>
<p>Both continue to work, but have been replaced by better alternatives.
<p>The discard action (tilde character) has been replaced by the "stop"
RainerScript directive. It is considered more intuitive and offers slightly
better performance.
<p>The omruleset module has been replaced by the "call" RainerScript directive.
Call permits to execute a ruleset like a subroutine, and does so with much
higher performance than omruleset did. Note that omruleset could be run off
an async queue. This was more a side than a desired effect and is not supported
by the call statement. If that effect was needed, it can simply be simulated by
running the called rulesets actions asynchronously (what in any case is the right
way to handle this).
<p>Note that the deprecated modules emit warning messages when being used.
They tell that the construct is deprecated and which statement is to be used
as replacement. This does <b>not</b> affect operations: both modules are still
fully operational and will not be removed in the v7 timeframe.

<h1>RELP Input Module</h1>
<p><b>Module Name:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; imrelp</b></p>
<p><b>Author: Rainer Gerhards</b></p>
<p><b>Description</b>:</p>
<p>Provides the ability to receive syslog messages via the
reliable RELP protocol. This module requires <a href="http://www.librelp.com">librelp</a> to be
present on the system. From the user's point of view, imrelp works much
like imtcp or imgssapi, except that no message loss can occur. Please
note that with the currently supported relp protocol version, a minor
message duplication may occur if a network connection between the relp
client and relp server breaks after the client could successfully send
some messages but the server could not acknowledge them. The window of
opportunity is very slim, but in theory this is possible. Future
versions of RELP will prevent this. Please also note that rsyslogd may
lose a few messages if rsyslog is shutdown while a network conneciton
to the server is broken and could not yet be recovered. Future version
of RELP support in rsyslog will prevent that. Please note that both
scenarios also exists with plain tcp syslog. RELP, even with the small
nits outlined above, is a much more reliable solution than plain tcp
syslog and so it is highly suggested to use RELP instead of plain tcp.
Clients send messages to the RELP server via omrelp.</p>

<p><b>Module Parameters</b>:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Ruleset</b> &lt;name&gt; (requires v7.5.0+)</br>
	Binds the specified ruleset to <b>all</b> RELP listeners.
</ul>
<p><b>Input Parameters</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Port</b> &lt;port&gt;<br>
Starts a RELP server on selected port</li>
<li><b>tls</b> (not mandatory, values "on","off", default "off")<br>
If set to "on", the RELP connection will be encrypted by TLS,
so that the data is protected against observers. Please note
that both the client and the server must have set TLS to
either "on" or "off". Other combinations lead to unpredictable
results.
</li>
<li><b>tls.compression</b> (not mandatory, values "on","off", default "off")<br>
The controls if the TLS stream should be compressed (zipped). While this
increases CPU use, the network bandwidth should be reduced. Note that
typical text-based log records usually compress rather well.
</li>
<li><b>tls.dhbits</b> (not mandatory, integer)<br>
This setting controls how many bits are used for Diffie-Hellman key
generation. If not set, the librelp default is used. For secrity
reasons, at least 1024 bits should be used. Please note that the number
of bits must be supported by GnuTLS. If an invalid number is given, rsyslog
will report an error when the listener is started. We do this to be transparent
to changes/upgrades in GnuTLS (to check at config processing time, we would need
to hardcode the supported bits and keep them in sync with GnuTLS - this is
even impossible when custom GnuTLS changes are made...).
</li>
<li><b>tls.permittedPeer</b> peer</br>
Places access restrictions on this listener. Only peers which
have been listed in this parameter may connect. The validation
bases on the certificate the remote peer presents.<br>
The <i>peer</i> parameter lists permitted certificate
fingerprints. Note that it is an array parameter, so either
a single or multiple fingerprints can be listed. When a
non-permitted peer connects, the refusal is logged together
with it's fingerprint. So if the administrator knows this was
a valid request, he can simple add the fingerprint by copy and
paste from the logfile to rsyslog.conf.
<br>To specify multiple fingerprints, just enclose them
in braces like this:
<br>tls.permittedPeer=["SHA1:...1", "SHA1:....2"]
<br>To specify just a single peer, you can either
specify the string directly or enclose it in braces.
</li>
<li><b>tls.authMode</b> mode</br>
Sets the mode used for mutual authentication. Supported values are
either "<i>fingerprint</i>" or "<i>name"</i>.
<br>Fingerprint mode  basically is what SSH
does. It does not require a full PKI to be present, instead self-signed
certs can be used on all peers. Even if a CA certificate is given, the
validity of the peer cert is NOT verified against it. Only the
certificate fingerprint counts.
<br>In "name" mode, certificate validation happens. Here, the matching
is done against the certificate's subjectAltName and, as a fallback,
the subject common name. If the certificate contains multiple names,
a match on any one of these names is considered good and permits the
peer to talk to rsyslog.
<li><b>tls.prioritystring</b> (not mandatory, string)<br>
This parameter permits to specify the so-called "priority string" to
GnuTLS. This string gives complete control over all crypto parameters,
including compression setting. For this reason, when the prioritystring
is specified, the "tls.compression" parameter has no effect and is
ignored.
<br>Full information about how to construct a priority string can be
found in the GnuTLS manual. At the time of this writing, this
information was contained in
<a href="http://gnutls.org/manual/html_node/Priority-Strings.html">section 6.10 of the GnuTLS manual</a>.
<br><b>Note: this is an expert parameter.</b> Do not use if you do
not exactly know what you are doing.

<b>Caveats/Known Bugs:</b>
<ul>
<li>see description</li>
<li>To obtain the remote system's IP address, you need to have at least
librelp 1.0.0 installed. Versions below it return the hostname instead
of the IP address.</li>
<li>Contrary to other inputs, the ruleset can only be bound to all listeners,
not specific ones. This is due to a currently existing limitation in librelp.
</ul>
<p><b>Sample:</b></p>
<p>This sets up a RELP server on port 20514.<br>

<h1>mmrfc5424addhmac</h1>
<p><b>Module Name:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mmrfc5424addhmac</b></p>
<p><b>Author: </b>Rainer Gerhards &lt;rgerhards@adiscon.com&gt;</p>
<p><b>Available since</b>: 7.5.6</p>
<p><b>Description</b>:</p>
<p>This module adds a hmac to RFC5424 structured data if not already present.
This is a custom module and uses openssl as requested by the sponsor.
This works exclusively for RFC5424 formatted messages; all others are ignored.
<p>If both <a href="mmpstrucdata.html">mmpstrucdata</a>
and mmrfc5424addhmac are to be used, the recommended calling sequence is
<ol>
<li>mmrfc5424addhmac
<li>mmpstrucdata
</ol>
with that sequence, the generated hash will become available for mmpstrucdata.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Module Configuration Parameters</b>:</p>
<p>Currently none.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Action Confguration Parameters</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>key</b><br>
The "key" (string) to be used to generate the hmac.
<li><b>hashfunction</b><br>
An openssl hash function name for the function to be used. This is passed
on to openssl, so see the openssl list of supported function names.
<li><b>sd_id</b><br>
The RFC5424 structured data ID to be used by this module. This is the
SD-ID that will be added. Note that nothing is added if this SD-ID
is already present.
</ul>

<p><b>Verification method</b>
<p>rsyslog does not contain any tools to verify a log file (this was not
part of the custom project). So you need to write your own verifier.
<p>When writing the verifier, keep in mind that the log file contains messages
with the hash SD-ID included. For obvious reasons, this SD-ID was not present when
the hash was created. So before the actual verification is done, this SD-ID must be
removed, and the remaining (original) message be verified. Also, it is important to
note that the output template must write the exact same message format that was
received. Otherwise, a verification failure will obviously occur - and must
so, because the message content actually was altered.
<p>So in a more formal description, verification of a message m can be done as follows:
<ol>
<li>let m' be m with the configured SD-ID removed (everything between []). Otherwise,
m' must be an exact duplicate of m.
<li>call openssl's HMAC function as follows:<br>
<code>HMAC(hashfunction, key, len(key), m', len(m'), hash, &amp;hashlen);</code></br>
Where hashfunction and key are the configured values and hash is an output
buffer for the hash.
<li>let h be the extracted hash value obtained from m within the relevant SD-ID. Be sure to convert the hex string back to the actual byte values.
<li>now compare hash and h under consideration of the sizes. If these values match
the verification succeeds, otherwise the message was modified.
</ol>
